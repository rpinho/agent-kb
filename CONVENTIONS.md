# Conventions — Structure, Routing, and Operations

Structural rules for the knowledge base. For how to fetch external sources, see the [`ingest`](.agents/skills/ingest/SKILL.md) skill.

## Conventions

### Source files (`raw/`)
- Organized by **author**, not by topic. One folder per person/publication: `Name - @handle/`.
- File naming: `YYYY-MM-DD - Author - Title.txt`.
- Topics are tracked via **tags in `index.md`**, not via folder names.
- Sources are **immutable** — never edit a raw file, only add new ones.

**Author-folder naming (when a handle doesn't apply):**
- Person with a known handle: `Name - @handle/`
- Person/publisher writing under their own domain: `Name - domain.tld/` (e.g. `Some Org - example.com/`)
- Never create show-named or topic-named folders. File a podcast under the **guest's** folder, with the show in the filename: `2026-01-15 - Guest Name - Episode Title (Show Name).txt`.
- **Content belongs to its author, not whoever shared it.** If someone recommends a video by another person, file the raw under the *actual* author, not the curator.

### Wiki articles (`wiki/`)
- Organized by **domain** (life-area / topic), not by author.
- **One-to-many.** Each article compiles MANY raw sources; each ingest updates MANY articles. The wiki is never a 1:1 mirror of raw.
- **Full routing, no lazy dumping.** Route every piece to its *proper* page. Don't dump everything into one catch-all "notes" file. This is the single most important discipline — a catch-all dump destroys the wiki's value.
- **Cite raw sources** for provenance, and **cross-link** between wiki pages with relative markdown links.
- **No artificial length limits.** Extract everything valuable; match the depth of the material. A good wiki page is comprehensive enough that reading it replaces reading the raw files.
- **Multi-speaker transcripts need speaker attribution** — most transcript tools don't tag speakers. Add a short attribution guide in the raw header, and flag genuinely ambiguous passages as "shared" rather than guessing.

### Filename hygiene
- **No Unicode** in filenames: straight quotes, hyphens, no em dashes, no emojis, no arrows/ellipsis.
- **No numbered prefixes** on folders (dates in filenames handle ordering).
- Folder names: Title Case or lowercase, spaces OK.

### Tags
Tags live in `index.md`, not in folder names. Define your own set for your domains; keep it small and reuse it.

## Routing — where new content goes

The routing table is *yours to define* per domain, but the shape is always the same. Examples:

| Kind of content | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| New raw source (transcript, thread, article) | `raw/sources/Author - @handle/YYYY-MM-DD - Author - Title.txt` |
| Objective data points (measurements, results, facts) | the domain's timeline/data page, e.g. `wiki/<domain>/Timeline.md` |
| Interpretation / analysis (what the data *means*) | a topical analysis page, e.g. `wiki/<domain>/<Topic>.md` |
| Active decisions / next steps / open items | `wiki/<domain>/Action Plan.md` **and** a line in `state.md` |
| Distilled lessons / principles | `wiki/<domain>/Learnings.md` |
| A recurring entity's profile (person, tool, ticker) | `wiki/<domain>/<Entity>.md`, updated over time |

**Define the routing for each domain up front**, so ingestion is mechanical. A useful mental model for a domain's file set:
- one page = *the facts / timeline*
- one page = *the interpretation*
- one page = *the open loops / action plan*
- one page = *the distilled principles*

When a source touches multiple domains, the article goes in the **primary** domain and cross-links the others.

## Operations

### Ingest
1. Fetch raw content (see the `ingest` skill) → save to `raw/sources/Author - @handle/`.
2. Chase every linked pointer (transcript, article, quoted item) before compiling.
3. **Compile** into the wiki — integrate into the existing knowledge graph, not a 1:1 summary beside the raw file.
4. Update `index.md` (source row, file count, tags) and append to `log.md`.
5. Record in the ledger (`scripts/ledger.py add`) — last.
6. Update `state.md` if an open loop opened or moved.
7. Commit.

### Query
Read `index.md` first, then drill into wiki/raw. Verify specific claims against local `raw/`+`wiki/` **before** the web. File good answers back into `wiki/`.

### Lint (periodic)
Scan for contradictions, stale claims, orphan pages, missing cross-references, and raw sources never compiled to wiki.

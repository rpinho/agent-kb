# agent-kb

**A file-based, agent-maintained knowledge base you run locally.** Clone it, point a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, ...) at it, and feed it what you read, decide and learn. The agent files each piece into the right place, keeps an index, remembers across sessions, and runs a scheduled digest, because the memory *is* the filesystem, not the model's context window.

This is a **scaffold**, not an app. No database, no account. It ships empty. What it gives you is a *system*: conventions, small scripts, git hooks and agent hooks that turn a directory of markdown into a durable, queryable second brain an agent can maintain for years. It is the persistent-agent memory layer, as a scaffold.

> The design follows the "LLM wiki" pattern (Karpathy, 2026): **the human curates sources and directs attention; the agent writes and maintains the wiki.** You don't type into a notes app. You hand the agent a podcast, a thread, a decision, and it compiles it into the knowledge graph.

---

## Why this works (the load-bearing ideas)

1. **The filesystem is the memory.** Plain markdown and JSON on disk. Any agent, any runtime, any editor can read it; it survives model upgrades and vendor changes; you can `grep` it, `git log` it, and read it yourself.

2. **Two layers: an immutable *raw* quarantine and a compiled *wiki*.** Everything ingested lands first in `raw/`, never edited, never trusted, one file per source. The agent compiles the signal into `wiki/`, the trusted, cross-linked layer you actually read. Untrusted input can never masquerade as settled knowledge.

3. **One source fans out to many wiki pages.** The wiki is organized by topic, not by source. Route each piece to where it belongs; never dump into a catch-all.

4. **Index-first retrieval.** `index.md` is the catalog the agent reads before it searches or answers; `log.md` is the append-only audit trail; `state.md` is the one-glance list of open loops.

5. **Idempotent, resumable ingestion.** A processed ledger (`scripts/ledger.py`) makes re-running an ingest safe and cheap.

6. **Enforce with architecture, not prose.** *(new in v2)* `architecture > compiler > CI/git hook > lint > prose`. Rules written only in `AGENTS.md` get broken. Every rule that broke once was promoted to a mechanism: a git hook, an agent hook, a lint that fails the build, a runner that cannot go silent. The prose stays as the explanation.

7. **Concurrency-safe by construction.** *(stronger in v2)* Every agent session runs in its own sparse git worktree and *lands* to `main` with a fast-forward-only merge. Hooks refuse edits and commits in the main tree, so the flow is enforced, not remembered.

8. **It protects you from yourself.** The highest-value thing a second brain does isn't recall, it's **intervention**: a KB that has watched you learns your recurring failure modes and pushes back when you're about to act against your own interest (and says so just as clearly when the evidence favours the risk you've been waiting to take). Post-mortems are how it learns the patterns. See `AGENTS.md` -> "The KB as a protector".

## Architecture

```
            you ── paste / link / "ingest this" ──┐
                                                  ▼
  ┌─────────── session worktree (one per agent session) ───────────┐
  │  raw/ (verbatim, immutable)  ->  wiki/ (compiled, cross-linked) │
  │  index.md · log.md · state.md · memory/                         │
  │  + one line in raw/_index/day-ledger.jsonl per ingest           │
  └──────────────── land: merge main in, fast-forward main ────────┘
                                                  │
  scheduled run (own worktree, nightly):          ▼
    probe -> phase 1 ingest (orchestrator + cheap sub-agents) -> brief
          -> phase 2 write (best writer, fresh session) -> digest
          -> digest-lint (compiler) -> one repair pass -> lint again
          -> consume day-ledger -> deliver | fallback digest | failure notice
          -> land (guarded; tomorrow self-heals anything stranded)
                                                  │
  readers:  kb-server (token-gated web reader + /home)  ·  alerts dir -> phone push
```

**Enforcement map** (what keeps each rule true):

| Rule | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| One agent per working tree | `shell/kb-launcher.zsh` (worktree per session) + `.claude/hooks/guard-main-tree.sh` + pre-commit check 1 |
| `raw/` is immutable | pre-commit check 2 |
| No secrets / private records in history | pre-commit check 3 |
| Every ingest reaches the next digest | `scripts/day-ledger.py` + pre-commit check 4 + digest-lint L5 |
| Printed docs don't contradict open items | `scripts/prep-lint.py` + `scripts/print.sh` + pre-commit check 5 |
| No `git add -A` accidents | pre-commit check 6 (blast radius) + settings deny rule |
| "Check the index before saying we never documented X" | SessionStart hook injecting a title index |
| Digest length, order, coverage, no permission-slip asks | `scripts/digest-lint.py` + repair pass |
| The digest is never silently missing | `scripts/nightly/run.sh` (EXIT trap, fallback, failure notice) |
| Failures reach a human the same day | `scripts/alert.py` (alerts dir -> digest top line + push loop) |
| Stale or contradictory open items get fixed | `scripts/coherence.py` (weekly report) + `scripts/state-hygiene.py` (nightly, judged) |

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <your-fork> ~/kb && cd ~/kb
git config core.hooksPath .githooks          # turn on the enforced rules
scripts/test-hooks.sh                        # watch every hook fire once

# worktree-per-session launcher (add to ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export KB_REPO=~/kb; source ~/kb/shell/kb-launcher.zsh' >> ~/.zshrc && exec zsh
kb-claude                                    # or: kb-codex
```

Then, to the agent:

> "Read AGENTS.md. Here's a podcast I want to remember: <url>. Ingest it."

It fetches the source, saves the raw transcript under `raw/sources/`, compiles the signal into `wiki/`, updates `index.md` and `log.md`, records both ledgers, and commits in its worktree. Say **"land"** to merge into `main`. Next session, ask *"what do we know about X?"*: it already knows which pages exist (the title index is injected at session start) and answers from what it filed.

**Make it yours:** edit `goals.md` (what is this KB *for*?), rename `wiki/example-domain/`, and delete the examples. Then, when you want it:
- **A scheduled digest:** fill in `scripts/nightly/prompt-*.md` (marked *YOUR SPEC*) and `models.env`, set `DIGEST_SEND_CMD` / `NOTICE_SEND_CMD` for `notify.sh`, test with `NIGHTLY_TEST=1 scripts/nightly/run.sh`, then schedule it (`scripts/launchd/`).
- **A reader for your phone:** `python3 scripts/kb-server.py`; put your own links in a gitignored `home-links.json`.
- **Backups:** `DEST=<synced folder> scripts/kb-encrypted-backup.sh`.

Python scripts use the standard library only (`kb-server.py` uses the `markdown` package if present and falls back to a built-in renderer). The scheduled runner needs `claude` and/or `codex` CLIs.

## What changed since v1

v1 (July 2026) was the core loop: raw/wiki split, index-first retrieval, the ledger, portable skills, the protector function. v2 is what running that loop daily for a few more months forced into existence. The theme: **every rule that failed as prose became a mechanism.**

- **Worktree-per-session is now the default path**, not advice: a shell launcher creates a sparse worktree per session; a PreToolUse hook (Claude and Codex) blocks agent edits in the main tree; the pre-commit hook blocks commits there. The `land` skill finds the main tree itself.
- **A real pre-commit hook** with six checks (worktree, raw immutability, never-commit paths, ingest-without-ledger, hand-over doc lint, blast radius) and a test script that exercises every branch.
- **A stateful digest**: `day-ledger.py` carries daytime ingests into the next scheduled digest; the lint fails a digest that drops one; the shell consumes the ledger only after a passing digest exists.
- **A digest compiler**: `digest-lint.py` (length, section order, ledger coverage, required mentions, permission-slip asks, tool-leak fingerprints; style reported, never gated) plus one automatic repair pass.
- **A lab-agnostic, two-phase scheduled runner** replacing the single-phase template: one adapter for `claude`/`codex`, probe through the real code path, failover backend, ingest capped by a writer deadline, EXIT trap, self-healing of stranded branches, pluggable delivery.
- **Same-day failure alerts** through one alerts directory (digest top line + a push loop), because email is where alarms go to be ignored.
- **Coherence tooling**: a weekly deterministic report and a nightly judged cleanup of open items that a newer entry already resolved.
- **Hand-over document lint** (`prep-lint.py` + `print.sh`): a printed sheet can no longer claim "nothing outstanding" about something `state.md` carries as open.
- **A token-gated web reader** with a phone home page and a "Latest" box for long living pages.
- **A SessionStart title index**, so "we never documented that" is checked against every page title before it is said.
- **Encrypted backups** that exclude media by default and count what the prune matched.
- **Docs**: new hard rules in `AGENTS.md` (enforcement hierarchy, capture facts in the same turn, never assert absence from an unverified search, standing permission for routine work); skills split into a short `SKILL.md` plus `references/`; memory conventions for a growing index.

## Design credits & philosophy

Built from a personal knowledge base an agent has maintained daily for about a year. This scaffold is the **system extracted from that KB**, rewritten as templates, with **none of the personal content**. It's the machine, published so others can run their own.

The core belief: *your knowledge, decisions, and taste are portable career capital.* Keep them in files you own, in a format any agent can read, and let the agent do the filing. See `AGENTS.md` for the full operating manual.
